# Project Health Check

Run a diagnostic scan of the current Spec Kit project to identify setup issues, missing artifacts, and configuration problems.

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

1. **Run diagnostic script**: Execute `{SCRIPT}` from the project root and review the output.

2. **Analyze results**: The script checks 6 areas:
   - **Project structure** — `.specify/`, `specs/`, `scripts/`, `templates/`, `memory/`, `constitution.md`
   - **AI agent configuration** — detects which agent folder is present, verifies commands exist
   - **Feature specifications** — lists features in `specs/`, checks for spec.md/plan.md/tasks.md
   - **Scripts health** — verifies all bash and PowerShell scripts are present and executable
   - **Extensions health** — validates extensions.yml and extension registry
   - **Git status** — checks if inside a git repo, shows current branch

3. **Report findings**: Present the diagnostic results to the user:
   - **Errors** — things that are broken and need fixing
   - **Warnings** — things that could cause problems
   - **Notes** — informational items about the project state

4. **Suggest fixes**: For each error or warning found, suggest the specific command or action needed to resolve it. Common fixes include:
   - Missing directories → `specify init --here`
   - Missing constitution → copy from `templates/constitution-template.md`
   - Missing feature artifacts → run `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.tasks`
   - Non-executable scripts → `chmod +x scripts/bash/*.sh`
   - Empty agent commands → `specify init --here --ai <agent>`
